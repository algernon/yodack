.SH "NAME"
yodack \- Ye Olde Debian Archive Control Kit
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.BI "yodack at " ftp\-master.debian.org " for dm " example@org " allow upload of package " "this, that" ", but deny uploading " something-else.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Ye Olde Debian Archive Control Kit (or \fByodack\fR for short) is a
simple tool to assist the young apprentice in commanding the \fIDAK\fR
side of the archive.

With this tool, one can easily construct command files, as understood
by the most recent \fIDAK\fRs, and upload them to the appropriate
place.

.SH "OPTIONS"

\fBYodack\fR understands some limited set of english, but is picky on
the order. One should start every sentence by telling the tool which
archive one wants to give commands to, followed by an action to take
on said archive, then the actions commands.

One can of course issue multiple actions, to multiple archives
too. Just make sure to finish the sentence with a dot.

As of now, \fBYodack\fR only recognises a single action, and while it
will not yell when it finds any other, the arguments for any action
not documented herein are ignored. All actions \- known or not \- will
end up being sent, however.

.IP "\fBdm\fR \fIkey\-id\fR \fBallow\fR \fIpackages...\fR \fBdeny\fR \fIpackages...\fR"
Grant or revoke access to a particular Debian Maintainer (identified
by the \fIkey\-id\fR) on the listed packages.

The maintainer will be looked up in the Debian Maintainer keyring, and
Yodack will ask for verification - or complain, if there is more than
one match. Yodack does not like to choose, it wants the young
apprentices to make their own choices.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.IP "\fByodack\fR \fIftp-master\fR \fBdm\fR \fIDEADBEEF\fR \fBallow\fR \fIhello\fR \fBdeny\fR \fIgoodbye\fR"

In the simplest case, with no filler text, this translates to allowing
the maintainer identified by the key \fIDEADBEEF\fR to upload the
package \fIhello\fR, but forbid him from uploading the \fIgoodbye\fR
package \- all this on the \fIftp\-master\fR archive.

.IP "\fByodack\fR on \fIftp-master\fR for \fBdm\fR \fIDEADBEEF\fR, please \fBallow\fR uploads of \fIhello\fR, but \fBdeny\fR uploading \fIgoodbye\fR."

This does exactly the same as the previous one, but has a few filler
words littered accross the command line to please master Yodack.

.IP "\fByodack\fR \fIftp-master\fR \fBdm\fR \fIDEADBEEF\fR \fBallow\fR \fIhello\fR \fBdeny\fR \fIgoodbye\fR. \fIsomewhere\-else\fR \fBanother\-action\fR."

While doing the same as the previous two examples, this one will also
do \fBanother\-action\fR on the \fIsomewhere\-else\fR archive.
